R packages are great in organizing all material such as source code, data and documentation belonging to a certain project into a standardized structure. This structure can be extended and together with some tools such as [`Rstudio`](https://www.rstudio.com) and [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools), it provides great functionality. 


## Other Guides
The ultimate guide to R package development is the document [`Writing R Extensions`](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html) that comes with every R installation and is part of the help system in R. Hadley Wickham has a book out on [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) which is also available online. 

The shortest description I have ever seen is the one on [Hillary Parker's blog](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch). I consider her blog post to be the minimal guide to constructing an R package. Some of the function calls have change though since the blog post was written. 

Something in between all the above mentioned references is Karl Browmans [`R package primer`](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer). I like his tutorial, because it explains many things very well, but it is still reasonably sized. 


## Why packages
Whenever I start a new project, I either create some new notes in Evernote, or I create a new directory somewhere on my harddrive or I start a new repository on github or I do something else. The problem with that rather chaotic approach is that a few weeks after the project gets started, someone else including future me, has enormous difficulties in understanding all the material that is available for that specific project.

Organizing everything into a project can help remedy that. Creating a package is very simple when doing it inside RStudio in connection with an RStudio project and when using the functionalities of package `devtools`. Once a package is created a standard structure of files and directories is given and source code, documentation and data are all stored in a given location inside the package directory tree.


## Let us get started
In RStudio a package is started by creating a new project. Use the menu `File` > `New Project`

![New Project](NewProject.png)

This starts the process of creating a new project in RStudio. The next screen shows three available options available for project creation.

![New Project Options](NewProjectOption.png)

The first option `New Directory` is used to start a new project from scratch in a new directory. The second option adds project-specific properties to an existing directory. Option number three allows the user to checkout or to clone a project from a version control repository such as [`github`](https://github.com/). 

### Start from scratch
In our example shown here, we start a new project from scratch using the first of the three project creation options. This brings up a window with three new options from which we choose to create a `New Package`

![New Package](NewPackage.png)

For our new package, we have to specify a package name. Optionally, the directory where the package should be stored can be indicated and with the check box `Create a git repository` checked, an empty git repository is created.

## Congratulations
That is all, a minimal package is created. Besides a `Hello world` function there is not much more functionality available so far. But that is easy to change. 

### R functions 
All R-functions should be stored in package subdirectory `R`. The functions should be documented using comments that follow the [`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) format specification. 
Based on those comments documentation in the `Rd` format can be generated using 

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::document()
```

### Vignettes
Vignettes are more extended documentation like articles that describe in more detail the functionality of the package components. A vignette document is created using 

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::use_vignette(name="myvignette")
```

This creates subdirectory `vignettes` if it does not exist and in that subdirectory it puts a template of a R-markdown document called `myvignette.Rmd`. This template can be changed to the desired content of the description of our package. 

## Testing
Before installing our package, we would like to test it first. The namespace of our package can be loaded using the command 

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

This simulates installation of the package and loading the namespace. Hence all functions become available in the current R-session.
